\section{Recommendations}

\color{red}
To do:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain how I fucked up and what more can be done to make it better
	\item Implement synchronised overlap and add algorithm
	\item Interpolate auto corr function for more resolution
	\item Do everything relative to a time function (easier plotting and
		debugging
	\item Do everything frame-wise
	\item Investigate remapping function of phase vocoder
	\item Some parameters, such as pitch acceptableness error, was taken at an
	arbitrary reasonable value. These values need to be determined physiologically.
\end{itemize}
