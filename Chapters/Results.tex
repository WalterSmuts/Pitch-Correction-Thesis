In this chapter, the results of metrics designed for the frequency detector and
pitch correction system will be given and interpreted. The frequency detector will
be discussed first and the pitch correction system will follow. Some real vocal
recordings will also be corrected using a few different configurations of the
pitch correction system. This is to give some confidence that the system can hadle
real data and doesn't just rely on clean signals the metrics have been designed
for. These examples are not rigorous by nature and should just be considered as a
final real world demonstaration.
