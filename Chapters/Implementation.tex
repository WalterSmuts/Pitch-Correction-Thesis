This chapter describes the design, module implemetation and final implemetations
of the pitch correction system. Since one of the goals of this report is to
compare the performance of using different modules, the evaluation metrics used
are described first. Theses metrics are described first to reflect the fact that
the metrics were designed before the structure and submodules were implemented in
an effort to minimise biased results. Once these metrics are well understood, the
desing and implementation of the pitch corrector and it's submodules are
described.

\section{Evaluation Metrics}

The goal of the metrics described below is to give a meaningful quantitative way
of measuring the success of the pitch corrector. It's a way to compare the
performance of different sub modules and choose the configuration that produces
the best result. Since the ultimate goal of an audio pitch corrector is to produce
better sounding music, the most rigorous way to judge the effectiveness of the
pitch corrector would be to run a psychological survey on which combination of sub
modules sound best. This is beyond the scope of this project. Instead, some
simplifications are made and metrics are designed based on the research done on
music theory. These metrics act as a proxy for the results given by a
physiological survey and are much easier and cheaper to run. Two aspects of the
pitch corrector are chosen to be assessed.  The effectiveness of it and the noise
or distortion of the audio signal introduced by the pitch corrector.

\color{red}
To Do:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Maybe describe the properties metrics should have
\end{itemize}
\color{black}

The effectiveness metric is a way of measuring how much the pitch corrector
corrects the pitch.

\color{red}
To Do:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Describe effectiveness metric further
\end{itemize}
\color{black}

The effectiveness metric unfortunately relies on the frequency detector to be
absolutely correct. This is because it depends on the results of the frequency
contour before the correction was mad and after the correction was made. Therefore
a separate metric is designed to evaluate the frequency detector as an individual
module.  This is to provide some confidence that the frequency detector module
does provide a reasonably good approximation for the actual frequency contour.

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}
