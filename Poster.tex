Below is a graph of what the final system achieved when it was presented with a
real vocal recording. It shows the pitch contour plots of a person singing a
folk-tune ``Hansie Slim'', recorded on a laptop microphone. The original pitch
contour is shown in blue.

From this graph it can be seen that the pitch contour after correction effect has
been applied(red), seems to ``track'' the wanted pitch contour(yellow).
