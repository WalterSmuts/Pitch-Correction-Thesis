\section*{\center Abstract}
\thispagestyle{plain}

This thesis investigates the design, implementation and testing of a pitch
correction system in the context of digital audio. A modular design is proposed
which contains a frequency detection module and a frequency scaling module.
Testing metrics are designed to evaluate the performance of the system as a whole
as well as individual modules separately. The algorithms implemented and tested
for the frequency detection module are the zero-crossing method and
autocorrelation method. For the frequency scaling module a simple overlap and add
method was tested a swell as the phase vocoder approach. The combination that
produces the best results is the phase vocoder and zero crossing method modules.
This approach achieves a pitch improvement factor of 4.38 and a similarity of 44\%
to the original signal.
